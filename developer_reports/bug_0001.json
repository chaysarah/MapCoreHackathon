  "ai_analysis": "**1. Summary of the Issue:**\n\nThe \"create device\" functionality is not working as expected.  The report lacks specifics, so the exact nature of the failure (e.g., error message, specific device type, point of failure) is unknown.\n\n**2. Potential Impact:**\n\n**High.**  Inability to create devices severely impacts core functionality, potentially halting user workflow and preventing the onboarding of new devices or users.  The exact impact depends on the system's reliance on device creation.\n\n**3. Suggested Priority:**\n\n**Urgent.**  Given the potential for significant disruption to core functionality, this issue needs immediate attention.\n\n**4. Technical Areas That Might Be Affected:**\n\n* **API:** If the \"create device\" function is exposed via an API, this could be the source of the problem.\n* **Database:** Issues with database interactions (e.g., inserting new device records) could be causing the failure.\n* **Frontend/UI:** A problem with the user interface might prevent the user from correctly submitting the necessary information.\n* **Backend Logic:**  Errors in the application logic processing device creation requests.\n* **Device drivers/integrations (if applicable):**  Problems with specific device drivers or integrations could prevent the successful creation.\n\n**5. Recommended Next Steps:**\n\n* **Request Clarification from User:** Ask the user for more details, including:\n    * **What specific steps did they take?** (A detailed reproduction guide is crucial)\n    * **What happened when they tried to create the device?** (Error message, any observed behavior)\n    * **What type of device were they trying to create?**\n    * **What browser and operating system are they using?**\n    * **Screenshots or screen recordings** (if possible)\n* **Reproduce the Issue:** Attempt to reproduce the bug using the information provided by the user.\n* **Check Logs:** Examine server-side logs for any errors related to device creation.\n* **Investigate Relevant Code:**  Analyze the code responsible for the \"create device\" functionality, paying attention to the areas listed in section 4.\n* **Test Related Functions:** Test functions directly related to \"create device\" to determine the scope of the problem.\n* **If possible, create a temporary workaround:** If the issue is severe, consider implementing a temporary workaround while a permanent fix is developed.\n\n\nBy following these steps, developers can quickly diagnose and resolve the issue, minimizing disruption to users.\n",
